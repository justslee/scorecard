## Data Models

```typescript
interface Round {
  id: string;
  courseName: string;
  date: string;
  players: Player[];
  scores: Score[];
  holes: HoleInfo[];
  status: 'active' | 'completed';
}

interface Score {
  playerId: string;
  holeNumber: number;
  strokes: number | null;
}
```

## OCR Setup

The scorecard scanning feature uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API.

1. Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Go to Settings in the app
3. Enter your API key
4. Start scanning scorecards!

**Note:** API calls are made directly from the browser. Your key is stored in localStorage and never sent to our servers.

## Usage

### Starting a Round

1. Tap "Start New Round"
2. Select a course or create a custom one
3. Add player names (1-6 players)
4. Tap "Start Round"

### Entering Scores

- Tap any cell in the score grid
- Use the number pad or keyboard to enter strokes
- Scores auto-advance to next player/hole
- Tap "Done" to close the input pad

### Scanning a Scorecard

1. Tap the 📷 button
2. Take a photo of your paper scorecard
3. The app will use OCR to extract scores
4. Review and confirm the imported scores

**Tips for best OCR results:**
- Good lighting
- Flat, unwrinkled scorecard
- Clear, legible handwriting
- Include player names in the photo
