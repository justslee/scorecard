"""Regression tests for `TeeShotNumbers` — the one-solve tee/positioning-shot
numbers block (specs/caddie-numbers-coherence-plan.md §2, §7 T-N1-T-N5).

Owner incident (2026-07, Bethpage Black hole 1, 466y par 4): the caddie
spoke a leave of 125, a raw bag driver of 300, and a physics total of 280 —
three truthful-in-isolation numbers from three unconnected sources that
never had to agree. This file locks the fix: ONE computed block that closes
exactly, and the structural root cause (the `/session/recommend` HTTP path
solving the hardcoded `yards=400` default instead of the real hole yardage).

Pure, no DB/network — mirrors `test_positioning_shot.py`'s bag/fixture style.
`recommend_payload` (T-N3) is DB-touching only for its persistence write
(`sessions.set_recommendation`), monkeypatched to a no-op here.

# Reviewer repro (2026-07): a steep-downhill short hole — 250y hole, a
# driver-200 (stored) bag, -60ft elevation. The physics drive
# (`drive_total_yards`) lands ~254y, which is > the 250y hole — the hole IS
# drivable. But the OLD `is_green_reachable` check judged reachability on
# the still-air plays-like frame (adjusted ~218y vs the stored 200y club +
# margin), which said NOT reachable, so the code took the positioning
# branch and printed a non-closing equation: "to_green 250 - drive 254 =
# leave 0" (floored; truth -4) while claiming the green was out of reach —
# the exact owner-does-the-subtraction confabulation trigger this whole
# cycle exists to kill. Fixed by reclassifying reachable whenever the
# PHYSICS-delivered drive total for the selected club reaches the raw
# to-green distance, even when the still-air frame disagrees.
